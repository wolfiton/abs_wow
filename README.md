## To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Edit the `config/dev.exs` and `config/test.exs` with your username of the postgress database user
  Example: For me it is `dan`

- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/api/graphiql`](http://localhost:4000/api/graphqil) from your browser.

The interface is playground
